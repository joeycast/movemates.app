## Customization

### Update Links

Replace the placeholder links in `index.html`, `privacy.html`, and `terms.html`:

1. **App Store Link**: Replace `#app-store-link` with your actual App Store URL (appears multiple times)
2. **X (Twitter)**: Replace `#x-link` with your X/Twitter profile URL (in footer of all pages)
3. **Contact Emails**: Update email addresses as needed:
   - `contact@movemates.app` - General contact
   - `privacy@movemates.app` - Privacy inquiries (in privacy.html)
   - `legal@movemates.app` - Legal/terms inquiries (in terms.html)
   - `safety@movemates.app` - Safety concerns (in safety.html)

### Update Legal Content

The privacy policy and terms of service pages contain **placeholder content**. You should:

1. **Review and customize** `privacy.html` with your actual privacy practices
2. **Review and customize** `terms.html` with your actual terms and conditions
3. **Add governing state** in the "Governing Law" section of terms.html (currently says "[Your State]")
4. **Consult a lawyer** before making these pages live, as they contain legally binding language

### Color Customization

Colors are defined as CSS variables in `styles.css` (lines 11-20):

```css
--primary-color: #007AFF;        /* Main brand color */
--secondary-color: #5856D6;      /* Accent color */
