            <strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 17, 2025<br>
            <strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 17, 2025
        </div>

        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Brink 13 Labs, LLC</strong> ("<strong>Brink 13 Labs</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," or "<strong>our</strong>"), a Tennessee limited liability company, collects, uses, discloses, and protects information about you when you use the Movemates iOS application (the "<strong>App</strong>") and related services (collectively, the "<strong>Services</strong>"). Movemates helps runners find partners and organize group runs ("<strong>Moves</strong>").</p>

        <p>Movemates is offered in the United States via the Apple App Store. You must be <strong>18 years or older</strong> to use the Services.</p>

        <div class="privacy-summary">
            <p><strong>Quick summary (not a substitute for the full policy):</strong> We collect the information you provide (e.g., name, age, gender, location, runner profile, photos, and Move details); and technical data (e.g., device and usage data, crash logs, and push tokens). We use this to operate the App, match runners, host profiles and chat, send notifications, and keep the platform safe. We use Firebase to host data in the U.S. We do <strong>not</strong> sell or "share" your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising. You can access, correct, or delete your data. Promotional emails can be opted out at any time. Questions? <strong><a href="mailto:contact@movemates.app">contact@movemates.app</a></strong>.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>1) Scope &amp; Controller</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Controller:</strong> Brink 13 Labs, LLC, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.</li>
            <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> This Policy applies to the App and any in-App or email communications we send.</li>
            <li><strong>Third parties:</strong> This Policy does not apply to third-party websites/services you may access through the Services (e.g., Strava profiles) or to Apple's App Store.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2) Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>A. Information You Provide</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account &amp; Profile:</strong> first and last name; email (via authentication); date of birth (stored and used to calculate/display age); gender; bio; interests; running data (pace, weekly mileage, commitment level, preferred running times); favorite shoes; goals; upcoming races; profile photos (<strong>stored in Firebase Storage</strong>); optional Strava profile URL.</li>
            <li><strong>Discovery &amp; Preferences:</strong> city and state, plus latitude/longitude representing the <strong>city centroid</strong> (not precise GPS); search filters; gender visibility preferences; profile visibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Moves:</strong> event title, activity type (run/walk/run-walk), distance, date/time, location addresses and map coordinates, notes, RSVPs/attendance.</li>
            <li><strong>Messaging:</strong> direct messages and group chats for Moves (see retention below).</li>
            <li><strong>Premium Status:</strong> subscription tier, expiration date, auto-renew status, source (App Store/promo/admin).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Information Collected Automatically</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device &amp; App Data:</strong> device model, OS version, app version, language, time zone, system settings, and device identifiers (e.g., App Instance ID). IP addresses may be logged by our hosting provider (Firebase/Google Cloud) in standard server access logs.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage &amp; Analytics:</strong> feature usage, screens viewed, taps, session duration, referral/attribution data, crash reports and diagnostics.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Signals:</strong> Firebase Authentication user ID, App Check tokens (App Attest/DeviceCheck), and related security metadata.</li>
            <li><strong>Push Tokens:</strong> for notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>C. Location Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We <strong>do not</strong> track or store your continuous/precise GPS location. However, if you grant location permission, we may access your current device location to show you nearby runners and sort results by distance. <strong>This location is used only on your device and is never stored on our servers.</strong></li>
            <li>You provide your <strong>city</strong> (either by granting location permission for automatic detection or by manual selection) and we store the <strong>city-level</strong> coordinates (latitude/longitude) to compute approximate distances for matching and discovery.</li>
            <li>Locations for <strong>Moves</strong> are stored as coordinates and addresses <strong>you</strong> select.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>D. Sources of Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You (through in-App forms and settings).</li>
            <li>Your device (through the App).</li>
            <li>Apple (subscription validation).</li>
            <li>Firebase services (analytics, crash logs, security signals).</li>
            <li>Optional: links you post (e.g., Strava URL).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3) How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We process personal information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Provide and operate</strong> the Services (profiles, discovery, matching, Moves, messaging, notifications).</li>
            <li><strong>Personalize</strong> results (e.g., show nearby runners by city and compatible preferences).</li>
            <li><strong>Facilitate subscriptions</strong> (verify Premium status; manage entitlements; handle grace periods).</li>
            <li><strong>Safety, moderation, and compliance</strong> (detect, prevent, and address fraud, abuse, violations of our Terms or Community Guidelines, and legal requests). This includes processing user reports submitted via the in-app Report User feature, which collects information about both the reported user and the reporting user.</li>
            <li><strong>Improve and develop</strong> features, performance, and usability (analytics, A/B tests, diagnostics).</li>
            <li><strong>Communicate</strong> with you (transactional messages about accounts, Moves, safety notices, updates, policy changes).</li>
            <li><strong>Marketing</strong> (with your consent where required): limited promotional emails/push; you may opt-out.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4) Legal Bases (where applicable)</h2>
        <p>While Movemates is U.S.-focused, if you use the Services from outside the U.S., you consent to processing in and transfer to the U.S. We rely on your consent, our legitimate interests in providing and improving the Services and safety, and contract performance.</p>

        <h2>5) How We Share Information</h2>
        <p>We may disclose information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers/Processors:</strong> Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Cloud Messaging, App Check) and Google Cloud hosting; analytics/diagnostics; email/push providers; content moderation vendors; customer support tools. These parties process data under instructions and appropriate safeguards.</li>
            <li><strong>Apple:</strong> for subscription validation and billing; Apple processes payments subject to Apple's terms and privacy notices.</li>
            <li><strong>Other Users:</strong> your chosen profile information, photos, age (derived), city, preferences, and content you post (including in Moves and chat) are visible according to your settings and the App's functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Law Enforcement/Legal:</strong> when required by law, court order, or to protect rights, safety, property, and to enforce our Terms.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> in connection with a merger, acquisition, asset sale, financing, or similar event; we will provide notice and choices where required.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="privacy-highlight">
            <p><strong>We do not sell your personal information</strong> and we do not "share" it for cross-context behavioral advertising as those terms are defined under California law.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>6) Retention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> kept while your account is active.</li>
            <li><strong>Chat History:</strong> All messages are stored indefinitely. Free users can view messages from the last 30 days only. Premium users can view their full message history. If you downgrade from Premium to Free, messages older than 30 days will be hidden from your view but remain stored in our systems. Re-upgrading to Premium restores access to all historical messages.</li>
            <li><strong>Moves &amp; RSVPs:</strong> retained as necessary to operate the Services; past Move metadata may be archived.</li>
            <li><strong>Backups/Logs:</strong> limited-time backups and server logs are kept for security, continuity, and compliance.</li>
            <li><strong>Deleted Accounts:</strong> we delete or de-identify personal data within a reasonable period, subject to legal retention requirements and backup cycles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7) Your Choices &amp; Rights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Profile Controls:</strong> edit your profile information at any time. Profile visibility is controlled at the profile level—you cannot hide individual fields (e.g., specific photos or running metrics) while keeping your profile visible. You can choose whether to show your profile in search, set which genders can see your profile, block users, and report violations using the in-app Report User feature.</li>
            <li><strong>Communications:</strong> opt out of push notifications via device settings (transactional messages may still be sent as required for service functionality).</li>
            <li><strong>Access/Correction/Deletion:</strong> Account deletion requests are handled by our support team and processed within 30 days. Submit requests via the in-app button or by emailing <strong><a href="mailto:contact@movemates.app">contact@movemates.app</a></strong>. We may require verification.</li>
            <li><strong>California Privacy Rights (CCPA/CPRA):</strong> California residents may request (1) to know/access specific pieces and categories of personal information, (2) correction, (3) deletion, and (4) information about disclosures for business purposes. We do not sell/share personal information. We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes beyond those permitted by law. You may designate an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf. We will respond within statutory timeframes.</li>
            <li><strong>Shine the Light:</strong> We do not disclose personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We do not provide financial incentives for the sale or retention of personal information as defined by California law.</p>

        <h2>8) Cookies/SDKs &amp; Do Not Track</h2>
        <p>We do not use traditional web cookies in the App. We use SDKs (e.g., Firebase) that may collect device and usage information to provide analytics, messaging, and diagnostics. The App does not respond to "Do Not Track" signals; mobile OS privacy settings may offer relevant controls.</p>

        <h2>9) Security</h2>
        <p>We use technical and organizational safeguards appropriate to the nature of the data, including: TLS encryption in transit; Firebase Authentication; App Check with App Attest/DeviceCheck; Firestore security rules; access controls and monitoring. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>10) Children</h2>
        <p>Movemates is for <strong>adults (18+)</strong> only. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 18. If we learn we have collected data from a minor, we will delete it. Report concerns to contact@movemates.app.</p>

        <h2>11) International Users</h2>
        <p>The Services are offered in the U.S. If you access from outside the U.S., you understand your information will be transferred to and processed in the United States, where laws may differ from those in your country.</p>

        <h2>12) Third-Party Links &amp; Services</h2>
        <p>Links to third-party sites/services (e.g., Strava profiles) are provided for convenience. Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies, not this Policy.</p>

        <h2>13) Breach Notification</h2>
