        <div class="terms-dates">
            <strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 17, 2025<br>
            <strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 17, 2025
        </div>

        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") form a binding agreement between <strong>Brink 13 Labs, LLC</strong> ("Brink 13 Labs," "we," "us," or "our") and the person or entity agreeing to these Terms ("you"). By accessing or using the Movemates iOS application and Services (defined below), you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.</p>

        <div class="terms-summary">
            <p><strong>Summary (not a substitute for the full Terms):</strong> Movemates connects adult runners to plan group runs and chat. You must be 18+. Be respectful, follow the Community Guidelines, and use common‑sense safety practices. We don't conduct background checks, and in‑person meetings and physical activity involve risk that you accept. Subscriptions are billed via Apple and auto‑renew unless canceled in iOS Settings. Disputes are resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, with a 30‑day email opt‑out.</p>
        </div>

WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR‑FREE.</p>

        <h2>13) Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW: (A) WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES; AND (B) OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (i) AMOUNTS YOU PAID US (IF ANY) FOR PREMIUM IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM, OR (ii) $100. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW CERTAIN LIMITATIONS; THOSE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

        <h2>14) Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Brink 13 Labs and our officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to: (a) your User Content; (b) your conduct, including in‑person meetings or activities arranged through the Services; (c) your violation of these Terms or applicable law; or (d) your infringement or misappropriation of any rights of a third party.</p>

        <h2>15) DMCA &amp; IP Complaints</h2>

        <p><strong>Data Access &amp; Portability Requests (Email Only).</strong> We process requests to access or receive a copy of your personal information <strong>manually via email</strong>. To submit a request, email <strong><a href="mailto:support@movemates.app">support@movemates.app</a></strong> from the email associated with your account with the subject line <strong>"Data Request."</strong> Include your full name and the account email (including any Sign in with Apple relay address). We may request additional information to verify your identity before fulfilling the request. <strong>We do not currently offer an automated in-app export or download.</strong> We will respond within time periods required by applicable law.</p>

        <h2>17) Dispute Resolution; Arbitration; Class Action Waiver</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Informal Process First:</strong> Before filing a claim, you agree to email us at <strong><a href="mailto:contact@movemates.app">contact@movemates.app</a></strong> with "Dispute" in the subject and a description of your claim, and to try to resolve it informally for 30 days.</li>
            <li><strong>Binding Arbitration:</strong> Except for small claims court or claims for injunctive relief for IP or security misuse, any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Venue &amp; Law:</strong> Arbitration will take place by video/telephone or in Davidson County, Tennessee, at your election. The Federal Arbitration Act and Tennessee law govern this section.</li>
            <li><strong>Class‑Action &amp; Jury Waiver:</strong> You and we agree to bring claims only on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, consolidated, or representative action. You and we waive the right to a jury trial.</li>
            <li><strong>Arbitration Costs:</strong> AAA rules will govern fees; we will pay required consumer filing/admin fees where mandated.</li>
            <li><strong>Severability:</strong> If any part of this Section is found unenforceable, the remainder will still apply, except that the class‑action waiver may not be severed as to a claim.</li>
            <li><strong>30‑Day Opt‑Out:</strong> You may opt out of arbitration by emailing <strong><a href="mailto:contact@movemates.app">contact@movemates.app</a></strong> within 30 days of first accepting these Terms, stating your name, the email tied to your account, and that you opt out of arbitration. Opting out does not affect other provisions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>18) Termination</h2>
        <p>You may stop using the Services at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access (with or without notice) if we believe you violated these Terms, pose a risk, or as required by law. Upon termination, your license ends and certain provisions survive (e.g., Sections 5, 12–19).</p>

        <h2>19) Governing Law &amp; Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Tennessee, without regard to conflict‑of‑laws principles, and the Federal Arbitration Act as stated above. Subject to the arbitration provision, the exclusive venue for permissible court proceedings (e.g., small claims) is state or federal courts located in <strong>Davidson County, Tennessee</strong>, and you consent to personal jurisdiction there.</p>

        <h2>20) Force Majeure</h2>
        <p>We are not liable for any delay or failure to perform due to events beyond our reasonable control, including acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, riots, labor conditions, governmental action, power or internet failures.</p>

        <h2>21) Export; Sanctions</h2>
        <p>You represent that you are not located in a country embargoed by the U.S. or on any U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties. You agree to comply with U.S. export and sanctions laws.</p>

        <h2>22) General</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> These Terms, the Privacy Policy, and any supplemental terms or policies referenced herein are the entire agreement between you and us.</li>
            <li><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision is unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.</li>
            <li><strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not assign these Terms; we may assign them in connection with a merger, acquisition, or asset sale.</li>
            <li><strong>No Waiver:</strong> Our failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver.</li>
            <li><strong>Headings:</strong> For convenience only.</li>
            <li><strong>Notices:</strong> We may provide notices via the App, email, or other reasonable means. Data rights requests sent via in-app chat, report/block tools, or social media are not considered received; please use the email method described in Sections 16 and 23.</li>

            <h2>What We Expect</h2>

            <h3>Profile &amp; Account Behavior</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Be yourself.</strong> Use your real name and recent, recognizable photos of yourself.</li>
                <li><strong>Accurate info.</strong> Provide truthful information about your running pace, experience level, and preferences.</li>
                <li><strong>Appropriate photos.</strong> Profile photos should clearly show your face. No sunglasses-only photos, group photos where you can't be identified, or photos that don't show you.</li>
                <li><strong>One account per person.</strong> Do not create multiple accounts or impersonate others.</li>
                <li><strong>Age requirement.</strong> You must be 18 or older to use Movemates.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Creating &amp; Participating in Moves</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Legitimate activities only.</strong> Moves must be for running, walking, or fitness-related activities. No dates, social-only hangouts, or commercial events disguised as group runs.</li>
                <li><strong>Show up or communicate.</strong> If you RSVP to a Move, make a good-faith effort to attend. If plans change, update your RSVP or message the organizer.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect organizers.</strong> The Move organizer sets the pace, distance, and route. If it's not a good fit, find a different Move.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety first.</strong> Follow our Safety Tips when attending Moves, especially with people you haven't met before.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Messaging &amp; Communication</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stay on topic.</strong> Use messaging for coordinating runs, discussing routes, and getting to know running partners—not for harassment, solicitation, or off-topic spam.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect boundaries.</strong> If someone doesn't respond or asks you to stop messaging them, respect that.</li>
                <li><strong>No unsolicited content.</strong> Don't send unwanted photos, promotional content, or inappropriate messages.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Safety Guidelines for In-Person Meetups</h2>
            <p>We <strong>do not conduct background checks</strong>. Meeting people from the app involves risk that you accept. Follow these safety practices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meet in public places</strong> with other people around (parks, popular running trails, public track).</li>
                <li><strong>Tell someone</strong> where you're going, who you're meeting, and when you'll be back.</li>
                <li><strong>Share your location</strong> with a trusted friend or family member during the meetup.</li>
                <li><strong>Run during daylight</strong> whenever possible, especially for first meetups.</li>
                <li><strong>Bring your phone</strong> (charged) and ID with emergency contact info.</li>
                <li><strong>Trust your instincts.</strong> If something feels off, leave. Your safety comes first.</li>
                <li><strong>Start with group Moves.</strong> Meet new people in groups before one-on-one runs.</li>
                <li><strong>Stay aware.</strong> Don't wear both earbuds; keep one ear open to surroundings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>In an emergency:</strong> Call 911. Movemates does not provide emergency response.</p>
